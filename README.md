# ServeSense

Idea
A device that would project balls to the player and keep a score of the number of returns made back to the other side of the table.

Problem Statement
Introduce a practice partner for individuals seeking to practice table tennis without any training buddy.

SDGs in play
SDG 3 -- Good Health and Well-being
SDG 9 -- Industry , Innovation and Infrastructure

Constraints
We found that the component of requiring ball tracking was crucial and difficult to incorporate within such a short time.
Along with ball tracking, we also need quick technology to identify where and what the ball looked like and predict its trajectory for the racket to hit it on spot. This again seemed difficult to cover in the time period.

Solutions Brainstorming
We ensured that the final idea was challenging in some aspects,  but would overall provide a positive objective after the project was complete. While knowing the time/resource limit we would have to work within, our final idea of a table tennis ball projecting machine that also keeps track of returns and score. 

Final Solution
Name of the project

PaddlePal


Design process
The design would follow the mechanism of a ball shooter. Two wheels would be placed side by side connected to DC motors helping it rotate. This structure would be placed in a box for form. Two sets of vibration sensors are placed; one under the table and one on the racket. If both the sensors detect a vibration, a point is scored.

Throughout the project we were able utilise various skills we learnt over the course of the past year in our online as well offline skill building sessions. When we were creating the first prototype of the project, we used the Arduino UNO to connect various devices and we used the circuit making skills we had learnt in the Electronics course. Along with that, we also had to code the sensors and motor movement. We also used our knowledge from our PCB course and soldering to make a compact version of our device. While designing the outer box of our device, all the CAD lessons we had taken came handy. We made the 3-D outcome of our casing before laser cutting it to avoid any mistakes. While putting together the final project we also got to use power tools to build the structure. To sum up, all the skill building courses helped us create this final prototype in a way that would have been impossible to even think of before.

Challenges faced and solutions

The first step we worked on was to test the sensors and motors where we met our first challenge. The piezo electric sensors we first intended to use were unable to detect a movement. To oversome this, we used vibration sensors instead. 
The next problem we faced was 
Another problem we faced was soldering various wires together, as disconnection between them meant to current flow. For this we kept having to solder the motor wires to create a strong, compact structure.
